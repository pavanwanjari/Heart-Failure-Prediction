### About this dataset
* Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the number 1 cause of death globally, taking an estimated 17.9 million lives each year, which accounts for 31% of all deaths worlwide.
* Heart failure is a common event caused by CVDs and this dataset contains 12 features that can be used to predict mortality by heart failure.

* Most cardiovascular diseases can be prevented by addressing behavioural risk factors such as tobacco use, unhealthy diet and obesity, physical inactivity and harmful use of alcohol using population-wide strategies.

* People with cardiovascular disease or who are at high cardiovascular risk (due to the presence of one or more risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidaemia or already established disease) need early detection and management wherein a machine learning model can be of great help.

## Project Description:
* You already know the world is pacing with such a brisk pace and so do the diseases, and to cure the diseases, doctors have to devote their precious time and experience that they had. But what is more concerning is the increasing number of patients than ever before, which results in more doctors and manual work. Instead of doing that, wouldn't it be awesome if we have a model which can predict whether a patient is going to have or has a particular disease or not ? That’s what we are talking about here.
* The aim of this model is to predict whether a patient is going to have a heart failure or not based on certain input features. After that, we’re going to evaluate and find out how well our model is working.
* The dataset includes different parameters which are helpful to cut down the chase and helps us to know the target variable. These are the following parameters included:

1. 'age': 				Continuous variable
2. 'anaemia': 			Categorical variable
3. 'creatinine_phosphokinase': 	Continuous variable
4. 'diabetes': 			Categorical variable
5. 'ejection_fraction': 		Continuous variable
6. 'high_blood_pressure': 	Categorical variable
7. 'platelets': 			Continuous variable
8. 'serum_creatinine': 		Continuous variable
9. 'serum_sodium': 		Continuous variable
10. 'sex': 				Categorical variable
11. 'smoking': 			Categorical variable
12. 'time': 				Continuous variable
13. 'DEATH_EVENT': 		Categorical variable
